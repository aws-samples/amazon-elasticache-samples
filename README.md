## Tutorials

The following are tutorials covering various use cases for [Amazon ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/).

1. [Database Caching](./database-caching/) - Learn how to create a query cache for a relational database using Redis.  In this tutorial, we take you through the process of deploying an [Amazon Relational Database Service](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) RDS MySQL database and integrating an Amazon ElastiCache Redis cluster in front of the RDS instance in order to reduce query latency for often run MySQL queries.

2. [Session Store](./session-store/) - Discover how to manage user sessions in a web-based application using Redis.  In this tutorial, you will learn how to use ElastiCache for Redis as a distributed cache for session management. You will also learn the best practices for configuring your ElastiCache nodes and how to handle the sessions from your application. 

3. [Lambda Feature Store](./lambda-feature-store/) - Learn how Amazon ElastiCache can serve as the focal point for a custom-trained ML model to present recommendations to application and web users. Lambda functions are used to facilitate the interactions between ElastiCache for Redis and Amazon S3. Then review how AWS Lambda interacts with Amazon ElastiCache for Redis with insights loaded from a custom-built ML recommendation engine.

4. [Generative AI Virtual Assistant](./tutorials/genai-chatbot/) - Build a generative AI Virtual Assistant with [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/), [Langchain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) and [Amazon Elasticache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/)
